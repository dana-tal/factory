Factory Management System - REST API

This project is a Node.js + Express REST API server for managing a factory's employees, departments, and work shifts.  
It uses MongoDB Atlas as the database and is deployed for live demo on Render.

The project fulfills the functional and technical requirements defined in  
factory/docs/factory_requirements_doc.pdf.  
A full mapping between client pages and backend endpoints is provided in  
factory/docs/factory_web_pages_to_api_map.pdf.

Live Demo

Base URL:  
https://factory-hiqy.onrender.com/

Important:  
This app is hosted on Render's free tier, which means the server may go to sleep after periods of inactivity.  
Please allow up to 5 minutes for the first request to go through if the server is waking up.

You can check the API status at:  
https://factory-hiqy.onrender.com  

- While loading: it displays "Loading"  
- Once ready: it returns "API is running."

After the initial load, all further requests should respond instantly.
